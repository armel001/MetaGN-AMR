MissingOutputException in rule multiqc_nanoplot in file /data/armel/git/MetagenAMR-main/workflow/rules/multiqc_nanoplot.smk, line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/summary/multiqc_nanoplot.html
Removing output files of failed job multiqc_nanoplot since they might be corrupted:
results/summary
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
