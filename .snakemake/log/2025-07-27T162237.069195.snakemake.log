Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however important for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

MissingOutputException in rule plot_ARGs_all in file "/data/armel/git/MetagenAMR-main/workflow/rules/plot_ARGs_all.smk", line 1:
Job 16  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/summary/all_ARGs_counts.tsv (missing locally, parent dir contents: all_ARGs.png)
Removing output files of failed job plot_ARGs_all since they might be corrupted:
