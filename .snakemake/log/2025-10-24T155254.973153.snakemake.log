MissingOutputException in rule rgi in file "/data/armel/git/MetagenAMR-main/workflow/rules/rgi.smk", line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/HI02A/rgi/HI02A_rgi_summary.tsv (missing locally, parent dir contents: HI02A.json, HI02A.txt)
Removing output files of failed job rgi since they might be corrupted:
results/HI02A/rgi
Shutting down, this might take some time.
